# WorkbookConnection.Refresh method (Excel)

Refreshes a workbook connection.


## Syntax

_expression_.**Refresh**

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[WorkbookConnection](Excel.WorkbookConnection.md)** object.


## Remarks

If the **[DisplayAlerts](Excel.Application.DisplayAlerts.md)** property is **False**, dialog boxes are not displayed, and the **Refresh** method fails with the Insufficient Connection Information exception.

A refresh failure for one connection will not have any impact on refresh operations for the other connections.

If the connection loads a Power Query query into a worksheet table and evaluating the query results in an error (for example, an error raised by an `error` expression in the query, or by a function such as `Number.FromText` that fails while the query is evaluated), the **Refresh** method raises run-time error 1004 with a generic description ("Application-defined or object-defined error"). The error message produced by the query isn't included. To get the query's error message, refresh the table by using the **[Refresh](Excel.QueryTable.Refresh.md)** method of its **[QueryTable](Excel.QueryTable.md)** object instead. That method raises the same error number, and its description includes the query's error, for example `[Expression.Error] ...`.

Errors in individual cells of the query's result don't cause the refresh to fail. The refresh succeeds, and those cells are left empty.


## Example

This example refreshes every query table on the active sheet and writes the error message of each failed refresh to the Immediate window. Calling **Refresh** on the **WorkbookConnection** objects instead would report only the generic description.

```vb
Sub RefreshQueryTables()
    Dim lo As ListObject
    For Each lo In ActiveSheet.ListObjects
        If lo.SourceType = xlSrcQuery Then
            On Error Resume Next
            lo.QueryTable.Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
            If Err.Number <> 0 Then Debug.Print lo.Name & ": " & Err.Description
            On Error GoTo 0
        End If
    Next lo
End Sub
```
